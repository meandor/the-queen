The Queen is a authentication and authorization authority. The Queen authorizes you and 
will issue your passport for other services to grant you entree. It can therefore be used
as a [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) service.

The authentication process is Kerberos 5 compliant and uses sha-256 encryption/decryption.

All parts containing cryptographic methods are carefully selected and according to the latest (2018)
guidelines of the BSI (Bundesamt f√ºr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik).

The authorization process is OAuth2 compliant. It can be used to authorize other services and
web apps to access personal data (user data) from the queen.
